          <p>
            It's especially hard to concentrate when there are many tasks and
            all of them are important. Where is the legendary multitasking when
            you (and all the hiring managers in the world) need it the most? The
            thing is, it simply doesn't exist. Researchers
            <a
              href="https://dana.org/article/multicosts-of-multitasking/"
              class="link"
              >found out</a
            >
            that the brain struggles to focus even on two tasks at the same
            time. And when several important tasks come into focus, the body
            panics and releases cortisol and adrenaline — the "stress hormones".
            Because of this, we work carelessly: making mistakes and getting
            tired quickly.

          <h3 class="title-decor">Dopamine</h3>
          <p>
            It's clear with stress hormones, but there's more interesting stuff
            ahead. Our inability to focus also involves dopamine, which is
            completely opposite to stress. This substance participates in the
            brain's reward system. What's it doing here? We often get distracted
            from an important task by something more "pleasant" for the brain.
            For example, checking likes on social networks. At this time,
            dopamine is released — and we feel pleasure. It turns out to be a
            vicious circle: the more you get distracted, the more pleasure you
            get.

          <h3 class="title-decor">Multitasking</h3>
          <p>
            How can concentration decrease because of... concentration? Any
            stressful situation (and the rapidly changing world in general)
            makes our brain constantly "scan" the environment for danger. For
            example, reading news instead of working. But it's impossible to be
            focused all the time. Concentration is like a muscle, and it can
            fail if not allowed to rest.

          <h3 class="title-decor">Food</h3>
          <p>
            "Fast carbs" — sugar, white bread, sweets — deliver energy to the
            brain lightning-fast and help it work better. But this energy
            disappears just as quickly as it arrives. And we end up on
            "carbohydrate swings": as soon as the effect of "fast carbs" ends,
            we feel tired and sleepy. And we want more fast carbs.

            Yes, it's that very situation when the laptop screen shows code, the
            headphones play a podcast, and a video with funny ducks is playing
            in the background on the computer. As a result, the brain tries to
            switch from one task to another — and just can't. And to return to a
            state of full concentration, a person needs an average of 20
            minutes. So, the more time we spend on gadgets, the more time we
            then need to get back to work.

                Or leaves in a stream. It's about easy meditation that helps to
                calm down. Often, it's the anxious thoughts about difficult
                tasks that prevent these tasks from being accomplished. At such
                moments, you can close your eyes and imagine that the clear sky
                is you, and the clouds are your anxious thoughts. No matter how
                many there are — the clear sky will always be there, behind the
                clouds, and won't go anywhere. This exercise will help to return
                to the present moment, rather than worrying about potential
                problems from the future.

              <p>
                But not any, and not your favorite. Your favorite might be
                associated with strong positive emotions, which also distract a
                lot. Suitable is quiet, calm, moderately rhythmic music. You can
                even try a playlist with "white noise" or neuro music.

                that contemplating nature increases concentration, while after
                viewing urban landscapes it decreases. You can combine a walk
                with physical exercises or running — this way, more oxygen will
                enter the brain and it will work better. But even a simple
                twenty-minute walk is a great option.

                We're not your grandmother, but it's really important. Choose
                foods that prevent sharp spikes in blood sugar. For example,
                those high in fiber: vegetables, berries, legumes (chickpeas,
                lentils, beans), brown rice, whole grain wheat bread.

                Real paper books. It truly helps with concentration: to read a
                post on social networks, you need a few minutes or even seconds.
                But an interesting book can engage you for several hours and
                greatly trains directed attention.
